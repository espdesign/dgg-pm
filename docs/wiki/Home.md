# 📖 DGG-PM Documentation & Wiki

Welcome to the **DGG-PM** GitHub Wiki!

**DGG-PM** is a self-hosted, Discord-native project management platform designed to eliminate context-switching by embedding task tracking directly into Discord text channels, threads, forum posts, and direct messages.

## ⚡ Core Design Principles

- **Single Namespace (`/pm`)**: No top-level slash command clutter or collisions with other server bots.
- **100% Discord-Native**: Discord Server Roles are the real-time source of truth for squad rosters.
- **Zero-Command Workflows**: Pinned Forum Hubs, Modals, Dropdowns, and Action Cards allow daily operations without typing CLI commands.
- **Self-Healing State**: Stripping a Discord role instantly revokes lead privileges and cleans up database records automatically.
