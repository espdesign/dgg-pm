      - Tag Boundary: Forum Channel tags applied to a thread workspace never exceed Discord's
        5-tag limit and preserve existing non-managed custom tags.
      - Archive Invariant: Closed or archived tasks are guaranteed to remain archived after
        any background event or interaction update, preventing sidebar channel pollution.

        the implementation guarantees safe temporary unarchival and state restoration.
